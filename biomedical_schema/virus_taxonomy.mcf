description: "A virus is a submicroscopic infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism. Viruses infect all life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea. The classification of viruses is developed by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)."
