Node: dcid:BiologicalTaxonomyGroupFungi
name: "fungi"
typeOf: dcs:BiologicalTaxonomyGroupEnum
description: "A fungus is any member of the group of eukaryotic organisms that includes microorganisms such as yeasts and molds, as well as the more familiar mushrooms. These organisms are classified as one of the traditional eukaryotic kingdoms, along with Animalia, Plantae and either Protista or Protozoa and Chromista."

name: "invertebrate"
typeOf: dcs:BiologicalTaxonomyGroupEnum
description: "Invertebrates an umbrella term describing animals that neither develop nor retain a vertebral column (commonly known as a spine or backbone), which evolved from the notochord. It is a paraphyletic grouping including all animals excluding the chordate subphylum Vertebrata, i.e. vertebrates."

Node: dcid:BiologicalTaxonomyGroupPlant
name: "plant"
typeOf: dcs:BiologicalTaxonomyGroupEnum
description: "Plants are the eukaryotes that form the kingdom Plantae; they are predominantly photosynthetic. This means that they obtain their energy from sunlight, using chloroplasts derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria to produce sugars from carbon dioxide and water, using the green pigment chlorophyll. Exceptions are parasitic plants that have lost the genes for chlorophyll and photosynthesis, and obtain their energy from other plants or fungi."

name: "protozoa"
typeOf: dcs:BiologicalTaxonomyGroupEnum
description: "Protozoa are a polyphyletic group of single-celled eukaryotes, either free-living or parasitic, that feed on organic matter such as other microorganisms or organic debris."

name: "vertebrate mammalian"
typeOf: dcs:BiologicalTaxonomyGroupEnum
description: "A mammal (from Latin mamma 'breast') is a vertebrate animal of the class Mammalia. Mammals are characterized by the presence of milk-producing mammary glands for feeding their young, a neocortex region of the brain, fur or hair, and three middle ear bones."
