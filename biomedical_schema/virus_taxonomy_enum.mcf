description: "Composition of the virus genome and it's replication method. This follows the Baltimore Classification system, which groups viruses together based on their manner of mRNA synthesis. Characteristics directly related to this include whether the genome is made of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA), the strandedness of the genome, which can be either single- or double-stranded, and the sense of a single-stranded genome, which is either positive or negative."

name: "Double-Stranded DNA"
typeOf: dcs:VirusGenomeCompositionEnum
description: "A virus whose genome is composed of double stranded DNA (dsDNA). Belongs to Baltimore classification Group I: double-stranded DNA viruses. All dsDNA viruses have their mRNA synthesized in a three-step process. First, a transcription preinitiation complex binds to the DNA upstream of the site where transcription begins, allowing for the recruitment of a host RNA polymerase. Second, once the RNA polymerase is recruited, it uses the negative strand as a template for synthesizing mRNA strands. Third, the RNA polymerase terminates transcription upon reaching a specific signal, such as a polyadenylation site."

Belongs to Baltimore Classification Group II: single-stranded DNA viruses. ssDNA viruses have the same manner of transcription as dsDNA viruses. However, because the genome is single-stranded, it is first made into a double-stranded form by a DNA polymerase upon entering a host cell. mRNA is then synthesized from the double-stranded form. The double-stranded form of ssDNA viruses may be produced either directly after entry into a cell or as a consequence of replication of the viral genome."

typeOf: dcs:VirusGenomeCompositionEnum
description: "A virus whose genome is double-stranded DNA that has an RNA intermediate (dsDNA-RT) in its replication cycle. Belongs to Baltimore Classification Group VII: double-stranded DNA viruses with an RNA intermediate. dsDNA-RT viruses have a gap in one strand, which is repaired to create a complete dsDNA genome prior to transcription. dsDNA-RT viruses are transcribed in the same manner as dsDNA viruses, but make use of reverse transcription to replicate their circular genome while it is still in the capsid. The host cell's RNA polymerase II transcribes RNA strands from the genome in the cytoplasm, and the genome is replicated from these RNA strands. The dsDNA genome is produced from pregenomic RNA strands via the same general mechanism as ssRNA-RT viruses, but with replication occurring in a loop around the circular genome. After replication, the dsDNA genome may be packed or sent to the nucleus for further rounds of transcription."

typeOf: dcs:VirusGenomeCompositionEnum
description: "A virus whose genome is composed of double stranded RNA (dsRNA). Belongs to Baltimore Classification Group III: double-stranded RNA viruses. After entering a host cell, the dsRNA genome is transcribed to mRNA from the negative strand by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The mRNA may be used for translation or replication. Single-stranded mRNA is replicated to form the dsRNA genome. The 5′-end of the genome may be naked, capped, or covalently bound to a viral protein."

name: "Single-Stranded RNA-Positive"
typeOf: dcs:VirusGenomeCompositionEnum
description: "A virus whose genome is composed of positive sense single stranded RNA (+ssRNA). Belongs to Baltimore Classification Group IV: positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses. For +ssRNA viruses, the genome functions as mRNA, so no transcription is required for translation. +ssRNA viruses will also, however, produce positive sense copies of the genome from negative sense strands of an intermediate dsRNA genome. This acts as both a transcription and a replication process since the replicated RNA is also mRNA. The 5′-end may be naked, capped, or covalently bound to a viral protein, and the 3′-end may be naked or polyadenylated."

Node: dcid:VirusGenomeCompositionSingleStrandedRNANegative
name: "Single-Stranded RNA-Negative"
typeOf: dcs:VirusGenomeCompositionEnum
description: "A virus whose genome is composed of negative sense single stranded RNA (-ssRNA). Belongs to Baltimore Classification Group V: negative sense single-stranded RNA viruses. mRNA, which is positive sense, is transcribed directly from the negative sense genome. The first process for -ssRNA transcription involves RdRp binding to a leader sequence on the 3′ end of the genome, transcribing a 5′ triphosphate-leader RNA that is capped, then stopping and restarting on a transcription signal which is capped, continuing until a stop signal is reached.[31] The second manner is similar but instead of synthesizing a cap, RdRp may make use of cap snatching, whereby a short sequence of host cell mRNA is taken and used as the 5′ cap of the viral mRNA.[32] Genomic -ssRNA is replicated from the positive sense antigenome in a similar manner as transcription, except in reverse using the antigenome as a template for the genome. RdRp moves from the 3′-end to the 5′-end of the antigenome and ignores all transcription signals when synthesizing genomic -ssRNA."

description: "A virus whose genome is positive-sense single-stranded RNA that has a DNA intermediate ((+)ssRNA-RT) in its replication cycle. Belongs to Baltimore Classification Group VI: single-stranded RNA viruses with a DNA intermediate. ssRNA-RT viruses are transcribed in the same manner as DNA viruses, but their linear genomes are first converted to a dsDNA form through a process called reverse transcription. The viral reverse transcriptase enzyme synthesizes a DNA strand from the ssRNA strand, and the RNA strand is degraded and replaced with a DNA strand to create a dsDNA genome. The genome is then integrated into the DNA of the host cell, where it is now called a provirus. The host cell's RNA polymerase II then transcribes RNA in the nucleus from the proviral DNA. Some of this RNA may become mRNA whereas other strands will become copies of the viral genome for replication."
