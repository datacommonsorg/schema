The other means through which clean-up operations at sites are financed include (i)individuals or companies responsible for the problems can clean up voluntarily with EPA or State Supervision. (ii) The responsible party or parties can be ordered to clean up by Federal or State legal action. (iii)A State or local government can choose to assume the responsibility to clean up without Federal dollars. (iv)The Superfund Trust Fund can pay for the cleanup, then seek to recover the costs later from the responsible party or parties. A site needs to be on the NPL in order for it to be eligible to financed through the Superfund Trust Fund."

Thus, an NPL Site can be (i)Proposed NPL Site, (ii) Final NPL Site [site is in the NPL list] and (iii) Deleted NPL site [site is removed from the NPL list]."
