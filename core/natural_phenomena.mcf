description: "Any fire ignited by management actions to meet specific objectives, e.g., the establishment/maintenance of healthy forests and grasslands or the enhancement of certain wildlife habitat. Prescribed fire is a well-established practice on public and private lands throughout the world, and is based on years of scientific research. Resource managers carefully calculate meteorological factors, fuels, slope of land, and other relevant conditions in planning prescribed fires. Utmost care is taken to protect human life and property, manage impacts of smoke, protect historical and archeological resources, and protect the ecological integrity of the physical and biological resources (NIFC.gov)."
