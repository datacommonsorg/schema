text: "The COVID-19 pandemic caused extreme poverty to rise in 2020 for the first time in decades, reversing global progress by three years. The share of the world’s population living in extreme poverty rose from 8.9 per cent in 2019 to 9.7 per cent in 2020, driven by increases in low- and lower-middle-income countries. In contrast, extreme poverty continue to decline in upper-middle- and high-income countries, attributed to swift fiscal support for vulnerable groups. By 2022, extreme poverty had returned to pre-pandemic levels in most countries, except low-income ones. In 2022, 712 million people (or 9 per cent of the world’s population) lived in extreme poverty, an increase of 23 million people over 2019. Projections suggest that by 2030, 590 million people, or 6.9 per cent of the global population, may remain in extreme poverty if current trends persist. \n\nIn the 75 most vulnerable countries, which qualify for concessional lending from the World Bank’s International Development Association, one in four people lives on less than $2.15 a day – eight times the global poverty rate. One in three of these countries is now poorer on average than before the pandemic. "

text: "The global working poverty rate slightly increased to 7.7 per cent in 2020 before declining to 6.9 per cent in 2023. This indicates a consistent downward trend in working poverty worldwide since 2015. Despite progress, nearly 241 million workers globally still lived in extreme poverty in 2023. Little positive change is expected in 2024. \n\nThere are wide regional disparities amid the overall positive global trend. Despite a falling working poverty rate, more than half of workers living in extreme poverty were still in sub-Saharan Africa (145 million). Central and Southern Asia notably reduced working poverty by 6.9 per centage points between 2015 and 2023. Conversely, Northern Africa and Western Asia saw an increase in the rate from 2.5 per cent in 2015 to 6.2 per cent in 2023. \n\nWorking poverty disproportionately affects some groups. Globally, youth are twice as likely as adults to be in working poverty. Women typically experience higher working poverty rates than men, with the most pronounced gender gap observed in the least developed countries (LDCs). "

text: "Based on recent data from about 100 countries, worldwide government spending on essential services – encompassing education, health and social protection – averages around 50 per cent of total government expenditure. Among advanced economies, this figure rises to 60 per cent, while in emerging market and developing economies, it stands at 40 per cent. Over the past two decades, both groups have seen a slight uptick in their shares, maintaining a consistent 20-per centage-point gap between them.\n\nOn the components of essential services, advanced economies notably outpace emerging market and developing economies in social protection spending by roughly 15 per centage points on average, largely due to broader pension coverage. Health spending accounts for about 5 per centage points of this difference. The pandemic temporarily skewed these trends, with increased spending on social protection and health and a decline in education expenditure due to school closures. While these measures are expected to be short-lived, prolonged health issues and educational losses among individuals could potentially have long-term impacts on human capital."

text: "After a sharp increase following the COVID-19 pandemic, global hunger, measured by the prevalence of undernourishment, stabilized at around 9.2 per cent of the population from 2021 to 2022. Between 691 million and 783 million people faced hunger in 2022. Considering the mid-range (735 million), 122 million more people faced hunger in 2022 than in 2019, when the prevalence was 7.9 per cent. Moreover, food insecurity levels remained high and unchanged for two consecutive years. An estimated 29.6 per cent of the world’s population, or 2.4 billion people, were moderately or severely food insecure in 2022. \n\nMalnutrition among children under age 5 remains a significant concern, posing heightened risks to their growth and development. Globally in 2022, an estimated 22.3 per cent of children under age 5, or 148 million, were affected by stunting (being too short for their age), down from 24.6 per cent in 2015. Based on current trends, 1 out of 5 (19.5 per cent) of children under age 5 will be affected by stunting in 2030. Some 37 million children (5.6 per cent) were overweight, while 45 million (6.8 per cent) experienced wasting, above the global target of 3 per cent by 2030. Three quarters of children under age 5 with stunting lived in Central and Southern Asia (36.7 per cent) and sub-Saharan Africa (38.3 per cent). More than half of those affected by wasting lived in Central and Southern Asia (56.2 per cent) and almost one quarter in sub-Saharan Africa (22.9 per cent). \n\nTo achieve Goal 2, significant efforts are needed to mitigate the impacts of climate change, conflict and economic crisis. Record-high food prices in 2022 worsened purchasing power and access to food, negatively impacting food security and nutritional outcomes. Increased global public expenditure on agriculture was at least one positive trend."

To assess global progress in sustainable agriculture, the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators adopted a new set of seven subindicators covering economic, social and environmental dimensions. Data from 2021 suggested that the world was at a moderate distance from achieving productive and sustainable agriculture (with a score of 3.4 out of 5) and had witnessed a slight improvement since 2015. Regional disparities were evident, however, with the highest score of 4.1 in Europe and Northern American compared to the lowest score of 2.6 in the LDCs. While more detailed analysis is required to investigate the root causes of varying rates of progress, evidence suggests that all regions urgently need to take sustained, concerted actions to improve productive and sustainable agriculture by 2030.

Per 10,000 people, these countries had medians of only 1.1 medical doctors, 7.5 nursing and midwifery personnel, 0.04 dentists and 0.2 pharmacists, compared with medians in high-income countries of 35.6 medical doctors, 76.8 nursing and midwifery personnel, 7.0 dentists and 8.8 pharmacists. \n\nHealth systems are experiencing increased strains in catering to the mounting health needs of an ageing global population, more so because the health workforce itself is ageing. An estimated 1.8 million additional health workers are needed in 54 countries, primarily high-income ones, to replace retiring health professionals and maintain the current age-standardized density of health workers."

Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia account for 87 per cent of maternal deaths. In 2020, the maternal mortality ratio in low-income countries was 430 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births compared to 13 in high-income nations. The average maternal mortality ratio for very high and high alert fragile states was 551 in 2020, more than twice the global average. Achieving the 2030 target requires an annual reduction rate of 11.6 per cent between 2021 and 2030.\n\nSkilled birth attendance has improved globally, rising from 80 per cent of births in 2015 to 86 per cent in 2023. Improved care quality could save the lives of up to 1 million newborns and 150,000 mothers annually. Yet progress is stalling; 18 million births occurred without skilled assistance in 2023. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 73 per cent of births were attended by skilled personnel in 2023, the lowest rate worldwide. In contrast, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia achieved a rate of 96 per cent."

Nearly half these deaths (2.3 million) occurred during the neonatal period (the first 28 days of life). The under-5 mortality rate was 37 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2022, a 51 per cent reduction since 2000 and a 14 per cent reduction from 2015.

The neonatal mortality rate followed a similar pattern, declining from 3.0 per cent to 1.8 per cent. If current trends continue, an estimated 35 million children will die before reaching their fifth birthday by 2030. If all countries met the target for under-5 mortality, an estimated 9 million lives could be saved by 2030. As of 2022, 134 countries had already met the target on under-5 mortality. Seven more were on track but 59 countries, nearly three quarters of which are in sub-Saharan Africa, will need faster progress to meet the target by 2030. "

Sub-Saharan Africa, the region most affected by HIV, has more than halved new infections annually since 2010. In 2022, 29.8 million of the 39 million people living with HIV were receiving life-saving treatment. Increased access to treatment has averted 20.8 million AIDS-related deaths in the past three decades. In addition, the integration of HIV testing and treatment with maternal and childcare services has prevented over 3.4 million HIV infections in children since 2000. Stronger linking of services for HIV and tuberculosis has averted an estimated 6.4 million tuberculosis-related deaths among people living with HIV from 2010 to 2022.\n\nNot everyone is benefiting equally from these advancements, however. In 2022, 43 per cent of the 1.5 million children living with HIV were not receiving treatment. Every week, 4,000 adolescent girls and young women acquired HIV; 3,100 lived in sub-Saharan Africa. Almost a quarter of new HIV infections were in Asia in 2022. Steep increases in numbers of new HIV infections have continued in Northern Africa and Western Asia. These worrying trends are primarily due to a lack of preventive services for people from marginalized and key populations, punitive laws, violence, social stigma and discrimination."

In 2022, an estimated 58 per cent of at-risk pregnant women did not receive the recommended preventive malaria therapy, and about one third of children with fever did not receive care from a health provider. Alongside disruptions caused by COVID-19, the global malaria response faces increasing threats, including drug and insecticide resistance, humanitarian crises, funding constraints, delays in programme implementation and climate change impacts. Despite these challenges, some important achievements sustain progress towards elimination in many countries with a low malaria burden, with 25 countries reporting fewer than 10 cases in 2022. Thirteen countries have been certified malaria-free since 2015."

A 2023 study of more than 530 ninth grade science and social science curricula found that 69 per cent did not mention climate change and 66 per cent omitted sustainability. Despite claims by some teachers that these topics were covered, 50 per cent admitted to not teaching them. Three quarters of countries expressed intentions to revise their curricula within the next three years to prioritize climate change and sustainability. Simply revising curricula may not be sufficient, however, if teachers lack the confidence or willingness to teach these subjects. Comprehensive support from schools, training institutions, communities and governments is essential to encourage educators to effectively transmit sustainability principles to future generations."

text: "Globally, pre-primary education has stagnated since the SDGs   were agreed. Seven out of 10 children globally attended organized learning one year before the official primary entry age in 2022, a rate unchanged since 2015. In sub-Saharan Africa and Northern Africa and Western Asia, less than half of children attended pre-primary school, despite previous progress. \n\nCOVID-19 reversed growth in pre-primary education, causing a decline of 1.5 per centage points. This particularly impacted the poorest children, as pre-primary education can mitigate disadvantages. Legal guarantees for free and compulsory pre-primary education are crucial to school readiness and equal opportunities, yet only a quarter of countries make it compulsory and only half offer it for free. Financial barriers persist in regions where the private provision of education is prevalent; in sub-Saharan Africa, 32 per cent of pre-primary students attend private institutions. Overall, children from the richest households are twice as likely to attend preschool compared to those from the least affluent households."

In 42 countries specifying treatment levels, 60 per cent of total wastewater flows were safely treated (with at least secondary treatment). Far fewer countries reported on the generation or treatment of industrial wastewater. Data on household wastewater from 140 countries and territories show that 58 per cent received safe treatment. Trends in domestic wastewater suggest that little, if any, progress is being made towards the target of halving the proportion of unsafe discharges by 2030. Large gaps in monitoring and reporting, particularly in low-income countries, result in an unclear picture of global wastewater.\n\nIn 2023, data on 91,000 water bodies from 120 countries revealed that 56 per cent had good water quality. Reporting on this indicator increased from 71 countries in 2017 to 120 in 2023. The 40 highest-income countries reported on 75 per cent of these water bodies, while 80 other countries reported on the remaining 25 per cent. More countries monitored rivers (101) than lakes and groundwater (71 each) due to technical challenges. This is concerning, as groundwater often constitutes the largest share of freshwater while lakes are vital ecosystems. Agriculture and untreated wastewater are major threats to water quality, releasing harmful excess nutrients. Degradation in water quality since 2017 is a concerning trend based on data from countries with extensive monitoring programmes. This trend may be global, given lower wastewater treatment rates in many low-income countries, but insufficient data limit confirmation. The lack of data obscures early warning signs, impedes restoration efforts and jeopardizes freshwater ecosystem services."

text: "Cooperative agreements among countries sharing transboundary water resources (rivers, lakes and aquifers) are essential for advancing sustainable development and addressing climate change. In 2024, only 43 out of 153 Member States sharing transboundary waters have operational arrangements covering 90 per cent or more of these resources. Over 20 countries lack any such arrangements. While progress has been notable in sub-Saharan Africa, where 16 countries now cover 90 per cent of their transboundary basins with operational arrangements, only a few countries in Asia, Latin America and North Africa have adequate arrangements. Alarmingly, nearly 43 per cent of countries lack flood alarm systems for any of their transboundary water bodies, 63 per cent go without drought alarm systems, 59 per cent have no joint climate change adaptation strategies for any of their transboundary basins and 64 per cent have yet to enact joint disaster risk reduction strategies. Since 2020, only around 10 new cooperation arrangements have been adopted for previously uncovered transboundary water bodies. Achieving coverage of all transboundary basins by 2030 will require significantly accelerated progress."

text: "Tackling climate change, water scarcity and other crises requires a comprehensive approach to managing water resources, across sectors and borders. Countries with higher levels of integrated water resources management (score 0 to 100 per cent) are more resilient to climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. Global progress in implementing integrated water resources management remains slow, however, edging up from a score of 49 per cent in 2017 to only 57 per cent in 2023, far short of the 2030 target of 91 to 100 per cent. Significant efforts to accelerate implementation are needed, particularly in Central and Southern Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa. Countries report that their main challenges are the lack of coordination across sectors and insufficient financial, institutional and technical capacity. Successful countries demonstrate that mainstreaming water resources in climate planning and financing allows them to build resilience and advance multiple development objectives, including for food, energy and ecosystems.

text: "In 2022, although the global electricity access rate held steady at 91 per cent, 685 million people still lacked electricity, 10 million more than in 2021 due to population growth. This marked the first such increase in a decade. The setback is largely attributed to the disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic and Ukraine conflict, which affected energy prices and markets. Those without access to electricity are predominantly in low-income households or located in remote areas. \n\nProgress varies by region. Central and Southern Asia reduced the regional gap from 235 million people in 2015 to 33 million in 2022. Sub-Saharan Africa had a growing share of the global access deficit, at 83 per cent (or 570 million people) in 2022, up from 50 per cent in 2010. While access to electricity grew globally at 0.77 per cent annually on average from 2010 to 2020, the rate slowed to 0.43 per cent from 2020 to 2022. With projections indicating that 660 million people globally will remain unserved by 2030, achieving universal electricity access will require a 1.08 per cent annual increase. Investing in decentralized renewable energy, including standalone off-grid solar and mini-grids, together with electricity-as-a-service models holds significant potential to bridge the access gap. "

This still leaves around 2.1 billion people relying on polluting fuels and technologies, such as wood, charcoal, dung and crop waste, as their primary energy source for cooking. Without stepped-up interventions, around 1.8 billion people or 21 per cent of the world’s population could lack access to clean cooking by 2030. \n\nAmong the regions, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and Central and Southern Asia have seen consistent improvements. By contrast, sub-Saharan Africa remains the only region where the deficit is rising; it could exceed 1 billion people without access by 2030. Globally, urban-rural disparities are stark, with 88 per cent of urban households compared to 54 per cent of rural households having access to clean cooking solutions. A reliance on traditional stoves and polluting fuels worsens health and environmental risks, particularly for women and children, who bear the brunt of cooking and fuel collection burdens.  "

Traditional uses of biomass accounted for slightly over a third of total renewable energy consumption.  \n\nThe electricity sector has emerged as a frontrunner in adopting wind and solar technologies due to their declining costs. Renewables constituted over 28 per cent of total final energy consumption for electricity in 2021, up from 23 per cent in 2015. This signals how the world’s capacity to generate renewable power is expanding at an unprecedented rate, presenting a tangible opportunity to triple global capacity by 2030, as agreed at the twenty-eighth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2023. Yet increases in renewable energy use remain constrained in the heating and transport sectors, which account for four fifths of total final energy consumption. "

text: "Globally, over 2 billion people were in informal employment in 2023, comprising 58.0 per cent of the global workforce, a share projected to slightly decrease to 57.8 per cent in 2024. This rate is down from 58.4 per cent in 2015, reaching its lowest point, but the number of informal workers is at its highest level. This suggests that widespread formalization is unlikely soon. Economic challenges are pushing workers into informal jobs without social protection, a significant barrier to social justice. Informal employment persisted most notably in the LDCs at 89.1 per cent in 2023, a rate nearly unchanged since 2015. The rate in Europe and Northern America was only 11.4 per cent. Women, particularly in the LDCs and regions with high informality rates, experienced a disproportionate increase in informal employment during the pandemic. Over 90 per cent of employed women in the LDCs and nearly 90 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and Southern Asia performed informal work.\n"

In 2022, the sector rebounded to 82 per cent of its 2019 level, contributing to 3.1 per cent of global GDP, as it tapped pent-up demand following the end of travel restrictions and resumption of air connections. While most regions are nearing 2019 levels, challenges persist for Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) and the small island developing States, with the economic performance of tourism at 68 per cent and 43 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, respectively. Tourism remains crucial for jobs, local ecosystems, peacebuilding and poverty reduction through income generation and tax revenues. Challenges such as inflation, climate change, geopolitical conflicts and uneven economic recovery threaten the sustainable development of the sector, particularly in small island developing States, which rely heavily on tourism.\n"

The manufacturing sector’s contribution to total economic activity, however, only marginally increased from 16.3 to 16.7 per cent during the same period. In 2022, manufacturing growth plateaued at around 2.7 per cent and is anticipated to remain stagnant in 2024.

Even so, the pace of progress may not be sufficient for the LDCs to reach the target of doubling their 2015 level of manufacturing value added in GDP by 2030.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020, the global share of manufacturing employment in total employment remained relatively stable at 14.3 per cent. It dropped to 14.1 per cent in 2022, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical crises that profoundly affected manufacturing sectors worldwide.

Despite playing a pivotal role in closing economic and social gaps, they face myriad challenges in the aftermath of the pandemic, including rising operational expenses due to inflation in energy and transportation and high interest rates on loans. Especially in lower-income nations, small enterprises bear the brunt of shocks due to their greater vulnerability. Access to credit, crucial for their survival, remains difficult. According to survey data from 2006 to 2023, only 16.9 per cent of small-scale manufacturing industries in sub-Saharan Africa received loans or lines of credit, well below the global average of 31 per cent.

The rate rose at a slower pace compared to 1.3 per cent in 2022 and was significantly lower than the global GDP growth rate of 3 per cent. This deceleration can be attributed to the significant surge in clean energy technologies since 2019. Coal was the primary driver of emissions growth, contributing over 65 per cent of the uptick in 2023. \n\nEmissions per unit of GDP consistently decreased, dropping 11.5 per cent from 0.29 kilograms per dollar (purchasing power parity) in 2015 to 0.25 in 2021. In manufacturing, emissions intensity decreased by 16 per cent, although regional disparities persist. Progress in reducing emissions intensity to cut global emissions overall has been insufficient.

This negative trend implies that rising labour productivity has not fully translated into higher labour compensation. Earnings from work are particularly important for less well-off and vulnerable people.

text: "In 2022, 24.8 per cent of the urban population lived in slums or informal settlements, slightly lower than 25 per cent in 2015 but higher than 24.2 per cent in 2020. The total slum population was 1.12 billion in 2022, 130 million more than in 2015, marking a reversal from the consistent decrease observed from 2000 to 2020. The setback was mainly in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (from 21.7 per cent in 2020 to 24.8 per cent in 2022) and sub-Saharan Africa (from 50.2 per cent in 2020 to 53.6 per cent in 2022). \n\nOver 85 per cent of all slum dwellers in 2022 were in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (362 million), Central and Southern Asia (334 million) and sub-Saharan Africa (265 million). Projections suggest that sub-Saharan Africa will experience the most substantial proportional increase, with an estimated extra 360 million slum dwellers by 2030 if current trends persist. This emphasizes the urgent need for a comprehensive approach to addressing the housing crisis, including through diverse housing options, while achieving equitable access to public transportation and essential services."

text: "Urban sprawl is characterized by the unplanned, low-density, uncontrolled expansion of urban areas into previously undeveloped rural or suburban areas. This unregulated growth has negative impacts on the natural environment and land use, contributing to increased air pollution and the loss of open spaces, wildlife habitats and agricultural land. Cities sprawled or grew outwards up to 3.7 times faster than they densified or grew upwards from 2000 to 2020, based on recent data from 1,217 cities in 185 countries. Globally, from 2000 to 2010, the average annual rate of sprawl reached 5.6 per cent while the annual densification rate lagged at 1.47 per cent. ^1^  The sprawl rate slightly declined from 2010 to 2020, dropping to 3.6 per cent annually. Yet the gap with the densification rate, estimated at 0.95 per cent annually during the same period, remained substantial. Sustainable urban development calls for mitigating the adverse impacts of urban sprawl and achieving a balanced approach to urban growth. "

Globally, the population-weighted exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) dropped from 39.1 ug/m3 in 2010‒2014 to 35.7 µg/m3 in 2015‒2019, a 9 per cent decline. Yet the level remains significantly higher than the recommended air quality guideline of 5 μg/m3 for public health protection. Eastern and South-Eastern Asia markedly improved air quality in 2015‒2019, after having the world’s second-highest PM2.5 concentrations in 2010‒2014. Similar advances in Europe and Northern America highlight the positive impacts of international cooperation and legislation, including the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. By contrast, air pollution in sub-Saharan Africa and Northern Africa and Western Asia increased from 2010‒2014 to 2015-2019.\n\nImproved air quality monitoring has been instrumental in confirming regional successes and informing policy decisions. Between 2011 and 2022, monitoring capacity worldwide grew sixfold, although 92 per cent of this expansion took place in high- and middle-income countries."

Yet many cities worldwide lack adequate urban transit infrastructure. Only 6 in 10 urban residents have convenient access to public transit, based on data collected in 2023 from 2,039 cities in 188 countries. The shortfall is particularly problematic in the LDCs, where less than 4 in 10 urban residents have accessible public transportation options, compared to 8 in 10 in more affluent regions.

Patterns of unsustainable consumption and production persist, however. In 2022, global food waste reached 1.05 billion metric tons, yet only 9 of 193 countries included food waste in their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) on climate change actions. The rapid growth of global e-waste remains largely unaddressed, with only 22 per cent collected and managed sustainably.\n- While domestic material consumption and material footprints continue to expand, growth rates have slowed. Regional disparities underscore the need for targeted interventions based on varying consumption patterns and environmental impacts.\n- Achieving Goal 12 requires fostering circular economy models, sustainable production practices, and responsible consumption. These approaches can take advantage of opportunities at every stage of production to reduce resource and fossil fuel use, drive innovation, conserve energy, and mitigate emissions. Progress largely depends on robust regulatory frameworks, financial incentives, and public awareness campaigns."

text: "In 2021, 13.2 per cent of food produced globally was lost after harvest and during transport, storage, wholesale and processing. An alarming 19 per cent of all food at the retail or consumption stage was wasted in 2022, totaling 1.05 billion metric tons of all food available to consumers. Most food waste occurred in households (60 per cent); each person wasted an average of 79 kilograms annually, more than the weight of the average person. Globally, an estimated 1 billion meals of edible food are wasted every day, equivalent to 1.3 meals per person impacted by hunger per day, considering that 783 million people faced hunger in 2022.  \n\nData suggest that household food waste varies by just 7 kilograms per capita each year across high-income, upper-middle-income and lower-middle-income countries. Hotter countries tend to have higher waste per capita, possibly due to increased consumption of fresh food with substantial inedible parts and inadequate refrigeration. Further, each year, food loss and waste generate 8 to 10 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, costing over $1 trillion and straining land resources and biodiversity. At the same time, as of 2022, only 9 of 193 countries had included food waste in their NDCs, revealing a significant gap in connecting this issue with climate action and the objective of halving food waste and reducing losses by 2030."

E-waste generation rose from 6.3 to 7.8 kilograms per capita from 2015 to 2022, reaching a total of 62 million metric tons of e-waste in 2022. Only 1.7 kilograms per capita was collected and managed in an environmentally sound manner. High-income countries achieved collection rates of over 40 per cent, yet most e-waste was inadequately recycled or exported to lower-income countries where management infrastructure is not developed, inadequate or absent. In Central and Southern Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa, collection rates are below 5 per cent. Inappropriate management by the informal sector results in environmental pollution and health hazards for workers and communities. \n\nBy 2030, e-waste generation is projected to increase to 10 kilograms per capita per year (or 82 million metric tons in total). If all countries boost their collection rates to 60 per cent, 54 million metric tons of e-waste would be managed in an environmentally sound manner, with 30 million metric tons of metal resources viably recovered.

New policies in 2023 integrated sustainable consumption and production patterns into high-impact sectors. The Philippines sought to promote responsible mining and enhance compliance with environmental laws, for instance. The United States planned to transform its food system for broader benefits. Australia’s Water Efficiency Labelling and Standard Scheme initiated efforts to reduce water demand and encourage efficient technologies.\n\nInternational standard setters have developed sustainability reporting standards for both the public and private sectors. While this represents positive progress, challenges persist given a lack of interoperability and inconsistency in national reporting requirements. In 2021‒2022, 73 per cent of sampled companies published sustainability reports, triple the share in 2016, with growth in all regions. Reporting is more common on environmental (water, emissions and energy efficiency) and governance (gender diversity, board meetings, bribery and corruption) dimensions than on social ones (human rights, health and safety, diversity and opportunity). The number of stock exchanges with written guidance on environmental, social and governance reporting continues to grow, from fewer than 10 a decade ago to 69 in 2022. "

Its compound annual growth rate declined from 3.9 per cent in 2003‒2012 to 0.9 per cent in 2013‒2022. Structural shifts in the composition of the material footprint stem from escalating reliance on non-metallic minerals and the diminishing relative impact of biomass. \n\nIn regions where the material footprint exceeds domestic material consumption, the latter decelerates faster, notably in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, Europe and Northern America, and Northern Africa and Western Asia. In these regions, the compound annual growth rate of the material footprint declined from 3.7 per cent to 0.8 per cent from 2003‒2012 to 2013‒2022, while the domestic material consumption rate dropped from 3.9 to 0.5 per cent. In regions where the material footprint is lower than domestic material consumption, including Central and Southern Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania, the compound annual growth rate decreased from 4.5 to 1.3 per cent for the former and from 3.8 to 1.6 per cent for the latter from 2003‒2012 to 2013‒2022.

About two thirds of emissions comprised CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes. Except transportation, emissions from all major sectors have rebounded since the pandemic and now exceed 2019 levels. The energy sector, responsible for 86 per cent of global CO2 emissions, remains the largest contributor, driven by the expansion of coal- and gas-fired power generation. Governments plan to produce around 110 per cent more fossil fuels by 2030 than would be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C.\n\nKeeping warming to 1.5°C calls for a 42 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, requiring an 8.7 per cent annual decline. For a 2°C limit, a 28 per cent drop by 2030 is necessary or a 5.3 per cent annual decrease. The only comparable fall was by 4.7 per cent during the pandemic from 2019 to 2020.\n\nCurrent national policies set the world on track for warming of 3°C. NDCs lower this to 2.5°C, while all net-zero pledges would put warming at 2°C, although these pledges are highly uncertain. There is currently only a 14 per cent chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C, underscoring the urgency of immediate, accelerated action to significantly cut emissions this decade.  "

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reports that the commitment was met for the first time in 2022. Climate finance increased by 30 per cent from 2021 to reach $115.9 billion in 2022, with 60 per cent of the total allocated to mitigation. Total adaptation finance rose to $32.4 billion from $10.1 billion in 2016. The 2021 Glasgow Climate Pact urged developed nations to double adaptation finance to developing countries from 2019 levels by 2025. Based on OECD figures, by 2022, developed countries were approximately halfway towards meeting this goal.\n\nNegotiations are under way to establish a new climate finance goal from 2025 onwards, starting from a floor of $100 billion annually, and taking into account developing countries’ needs and priorities. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) estimates that nearly $6 trillion is needed for developing countries’ climate action plans by 2030, underscoring the need to massively scale up finance.\n"

In 2015, the probability for such a temperature spike was near zero. The global mean near-surface temperature for each year from 2024 to 2028 is predicted to be 1.1°C to 1.9°C higher than the 1850‒1900 baseline. At least one of the next five years will likely surpass 2023 as the warmest on record."

text: "Fossil fuel subsidies reached a record high of $1.53 trillion in 2022, driven by rising energy prices post-pandemic and the impact of the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine, which disrupted global energy markets. The increase widened the gap between consumer prices and actual energy costs, prompting many governments to introduce support measures to shield industries and populations from inflation. Public funds shoring up the production and consumption of oil, coal and gas more than doubled between 2021 and 2022, and more than tripled from their 2015 levels, reversing progress made between 2012 and 2020 and hindering the net-zero transition. \n\nAll regions saw higher subsidies between 2021 and 2022, with the highest in Europe and Northern America ($455 billion), followed by Northern Africa and Western Asia ($327 billion) and Central and Southern Asia ($322 billion). By artificially lowering fossil fuel prices, subsidies harm the competitiveness of cleaner energy sources and hinder the low-carbon transition. They strain national budgets, especially in countries facing fiscal constraints and high debt levels. Although intended to aid vulnerable households, subsidies often disproportionately benefit wealthier people, who consume more energy than lower-income households, as well as carbon-intensive companies. Despite numerous national, regional and global pledges to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, data show minimal action. "

text: "According to the WMO, recorded disasters increased fivefold over the past 50 years, driven partly by human-induced climate change. The number of persons affected by disasters per 100,000 population rose from 1,169 (2005‒2014) to 1,980 (2013‒2022), a 69 per cent increase, as reported by the Sendai Framework Monitor. The total affected population averaged 133 million people annually from 2015 to 2022, up from 29 million annually from 2005 to 2014. If current trends continue, it is projected that 560 medium- to large-scale disaster events could occur annually by 2030, an average of 1.5 per day. \n\nIn LDCs, the disaster-affected population per 100,000 people is 20 per cent higher than the global average, and the mortality rate is 170 per cent higher. This illustrates that the catastrophic impact of disasters is much greater in these countries.\nImproved preparedness, including early warning systems and evacuation measures, have significantly reduced disaster mortality in recent years. Global disaster mortality per 100,000 population dropped by 49 per cent, from 1.62 in 2005‒2014 to 0.82 in 2013‒2022 (excluding COVID-19 related cases). This translates to an average annual mortality of 42,553 people between 2013 and 2022, a one-third decrease from the annual average in 2005‒2014. National long-term risk reduction strategies and plans, reported by 129 countries; the establishment of effective multi-hazard early warning systems, reported by 104 countries; and comprehensive resilience plans are key to minimizing disaster impacts on people and economies.

text: "The sustainability of global fishery resources declined from 90.0 per cent in 1974 to 64.6 per cent in 2019 and further to 62.3 per cent in 2021, due to overfishing, pollution, poor management and other factors. Fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels, however, comprised around 76.9 per cent of global marine fish landings in 2021. Averaging 80 million tons annually, global marine fish landings have remained relatively stable since 1995.\n\nTrends in 2021 for major fishing regions vary greatly, from 33 per cent to 84 per cent of fish stocks at sustainable levels (underfished and maximally sustainably fished). The Southeast Pacific had the highest percentage of overfished stocks at 66.7 per cent, followed by the Mediterranean and Black Sea at 62.5 per cent, the Northwest Pacific at 56 per cent and the Eastern Central Atlantic at 51.3 per cent. In contrast, the Eastern Central Pacific, Northeast Atlantic, Northeast Pacific and Southwest Pacific had the lowest proportions of overfished stocks, ranging from 16 to 24 per cent. \n\nOverfishing could harm biodiversity, ecosystems and fisheries production, and imposes adverse social and economic costs. Effective fisheries management can possibly reverse these effects (if they are driven by overfishing and not factors such as habitat degradation, pollution or climate change) and lead to optimal stock levels while supporting global food security and coastal communities. The ongoing albeit decelerated decline in biologically sustainable fish stocks worldwide underscores the need for enhanced regulatory frameworks and efficient monitoring systems. "

text: "The value added of fisheries and aquaculture rose by 10 per cent from 2019 to 2021. The contribution of sustainable fisheries to GDP declined 5.4 per cent in 2021, however, mainly due to the expansion of other economic sectors and the declining sustainability of several fish stocks in some regions. This marks a second consecutive drop following a brief period of growth from 2015 to 2017. Recovery from COVID-19 disruptions has been challenging, with the industry facing volatile demand and rising costs. \n\nSeveral countries that depend heavily on fisheries for livelihoods and food security, however, have seen positive developments. In sub-Saharan Africa, the contribution of sustainable fisheries to GDP climbed from 0.38 per cent in 2019 to 0.42 per cent in 2021. Small island developing States have similarly shown promising growth, from 0.46 per cent of GDP in 2019 to 0.51 per cent in 2021. Pacific small island developing States, which rank among the countries most dependent on fisheries globally, increased their share from 1.54 per cent of GDP in 2019 to 1.63 per cent in 2021. This rise underscores the sector’s potential to drive economic development. Sustaining economic dividends from fisheries, however, requires judicious fish stock management practices that prevent overexploitation and depletion."

text: "As of May 2024, there are 18,200 marine protected areas and 199 other effective, area-based conservation measures  covering over 29 million km² or 8.12 per cent of the ocean. This represents a more than tenfold increase in marine protected area coverage since 2000, largely due to the establishment of very large areas exceeding 100,000 km². Progress has stalled since 2020, however. Reaching the 10 per cent SDG target by 2030 calls for effectively managing important sites covering an average additional 1.13 million square kilometers of ocean each year. Renewed momentum for marine conservation is expected from global agreements. The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework commits to establish protected areas to safeguard areas of particular importance for biodiversity, adding up to cover 30 per cent of oceans by 2030. Additionally, the Agreement on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction   aims to protect marine biodiversity in international waters and seabed. Adequate management of such protected areas will be crucial to realize conservation benefits.\n\nMarine designations should also be strategically located to safeguard key biodiversity areas. Since 2000, average protected area coverage of marine key biodiversity areas has nearly doubled, but growth has stagnated since 2015. From 2000 to 2015, Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) saw a staggering 255 per cent increase in key biodiversity area coverage, followed by Northern Africa and Western Asia (128 per cent) and sub-Saharan Africa (86 per cent). Since 2015, sub-Saharan Africa has led with an 18 per cent increase, followed by Northern Africa and Western Asia (10 per cent). Less than 30 per cent of marine key biodiversity areas in Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand), Central and Southern Asia, and Northern Africa and Western Asia are protected, however, highlighting a critical need for action within the next six years."

According to the World Meteorological Organization, as of April 2024, sea surface temperatures had reached record highs for 13 consecutive months. In 2023, ocean heat content soared to its highest level in 65 years; over 90 per cent of the ocean experienced heatwave conditions at some point during the year. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration confirms the world is currently experiencing its fourth global coral bleaching event, the second in a decade. Bleaching has been observed in 53 countries and territories, including throughout the tropics, the Great Barrier Reef, large parts of the South Pacific, and the Atlantic and Indian ocean basins.\n\nAs oceans continue to warm amid rising global temperatures, the frequency and severity of coral bleaching will likely increase. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that up to 90 per cent of corals could be lost by 2050 at 1.5°C of warming and up to 99 per cent at 2°C. The survival of coral reefs is vital for ocean health and humanity’s well-being.\n"

text: "Between  2000 and 2020, the proportion of forest cover decreased from 31.9 per cent to 31.2 per cent of total land area, resulting in net forest area losses of nearly 100 million hectares. Agricultural expansion drove almost 90 per cent of global deforestation; cropland accounted for 49.6 per cent and livestock grazing for 38.5 per cent. Globally, small-scale farming caused 68 per cent of agriculture-driven deforestation, while large-scale farming contributed to 32 per cent. In Africa, small-scale farming was responsible for 97 per cent of agriculture-driven deforestation. Forest losses due to large-scale farming were highest in South America at 48 per cent (mainly linked to livestock grazing), followed by Asia at 38 per cent (primarily due to large-scale crop production, particularly for oil palm plantations).\n\nThese findings suggest that efforts to reduce deforestation must tackle production system weaknesses while addressing critical needs such as food security, income and land tenure rights for local communities. Stemming deforestation also demands a comprehensive approach blending regulatory measures, market incentives and stakeholder collaboration to promote sustainable land management and preserve forest ecosystems."

Illegal trade has affected around 4,000 plant and animal species in 162 countries and territories from 2015 to 2021. This exploitation jeopardizes the survival of species and undermines ecosystem functions, especially when compounded by other pressures, such as habitat loss and climate change. \n\nRecent estimates indicate that the intercepted illegal wildlife trade as a proportion of all wildlife trade (legal and illegal) has been on the rise since 2017, peaking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wildlife seizures comprised over 1.9 and 1.4 per cent of global wildlife trade in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Trends likely reflect a disproportionate reduction in legal trade during the pandemic and an increase in enforcement efforts for certain wildlife commodities. For instance, more wildlife seizures were primarily attributed to new regulations targeting high-value timber species from South America, alongside intensified enforcement actions. "

This degradation, driven by changes in land use and coverage, significantly contributes to biodiversity loss, including in fragile mountain ecosystems. The widespread transformation of mountain ecosystems is due to various natural and human-induced factors, such as climate change, natural hazards, unplanned agriculture and urbanization, timber extraction and recreation. Globally, only about a third of mountain Key Biodiversity Areas are safeguarded by protected areas or other effective area-based conservation measures.\n\nGlobal data from 2000 to 2018 indicate that degradation affects about 1.6 per cent of the world’s mountainous areas. The highest proportion of degraded mountain land is in the alpine areas of Europe and Northern America (2.29 per cent), followed by the montane areas of Central and Southern Asia (2.22 per cent) and the lower mountain belts of Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (2.17 per cent). Mountain ecosystem degradation threatens downstream water provision, through  reduced glacial coverage, as well as biodiversity and other ecosystem services, thereby undermining efforts to protect terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Furthermore, diminished forest and vegetation coverage increase soil erosion, heightening the risk of downstream landslides and flooding.\n"

text: "The global homicide rate gradually decreased from 5.9 victims per 100,000 population in 2015 to 5.5 in 2020. This downward trend was disrupted in 2021, when the rate sharply rose to 5.8 before slightly retreating to 5.6 in 2022. The global homicide rate declined by 5 per cent between 2015 and 2022. If this pattern persists, the rate is projected to be 5.1 per 100,000 population by 2030, an overall decrease of just 13 per cent since 2015. The two regions with the highest rates are Latin America and the Caribbean, which is plagued by organized crime and gang activities, and Africa, which has a large youth population, increased incidences of extreme heat and persistent inequality. In 2022, 88,000 women became homicide victims globally compared to 360,000 men."

text: "About 19 per cent of people reported being asked to pay or having paid a bribe to a public official in the last 12 months, based on 138 countries with available data from 2015 to 2022. Notable regional variations were apparent. In Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa, an average of 29.7 per cent and 26.6 per cent of the population, respectively, experienced bribery in the last 12 months, compared to 10.1 per cent in Europe and Northern America. The prevalence of bribery varied by national income level, ranging from an average of 9 per cent in high-income countries to 32 per cent in low-income countries. Data from 18 countries from 2010 to 2021 suggested that men were more likely than women to engage in bribery, often influenced by differing interactions with male-dominated sectors like the police or customs."

text: "The global prison population rose from 11.1 million in 2015 to 11.5 million in 2022, a growth rate slower than that of the world population as a whole. Consequently, the prisoner-to-population rate decreased from 150 prisoners per 100,000 population in 2015 to 144 per 100,000 in 2022. Central and Southern Asia had the lowest rates at 54 per 100,000, while Latin America and the Caribbean had the highest at 277 per 100,000. \n\nAccess to justice is a fundamental human right. In 2022, however, nearly a third (3.5 million) of the global prison population was held in pre-trial detention, a share that remained stable between 2015 and 2022. While most regions showed some improvements, Central and Southern Asia saw a worrying rise; almost 60 per cent of prisoners was held unsentenced. Overcrowding in prisons operating at over 100 per cent of intended capacity was a concern in half of countries with data. This issue was particularly severe in Latin America and the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa, where over three quarters of countries reported overcrowding. Globally, one in five countries operates prisons at over 150 per cent of intended capacity, with documented harm to health and higher rates of mortality."

Conflict zones saw a sharp increase in the killings of journalists and media workers, with 40 lives lost, reversing a downward trend since 2017. Latin America and the Caribbean remained the deadliest region, accounting for 70 per cent of all killings. Enforced disappearances globally nearly doubled for the second consecutive year, with at least 54 cases reported in 14 countries in 2023.\n\nNearly a decade since Member States committed to zero killings and attacks against defenders of rights and freedom of speech, incidents have been observed in at least 97 countries. The total number of annual killings has not fallen below 300 since 2015, with peaks in 2018 and 2022. Kidnapping, detention, legal harassment and online attacks are other major threats. Strong protection frameworks are needed to stem this trend, particularly in countries where violent conflict or social unrest erupts or escalates. "

text: "Governments across the world have found it difficult to return to pre-COVID-19 levels of budget reliability, in part due to new international challenges impacting economies, including global political instability, inflation and volatile resource prices. Attempts to support economic activity and address social stresses have resulted in higher budget expenditure than originally approved across all regions. Budget reliability improved in 2021 and 2022 compared to 2020 but remained weaker than pre-pandemic levels. Northern Africa and Western Asia, Central and Southern Asia, and Europe and Northern America experienced the highest spending deviations relative to the pre-pandemic period, likely due to factors such as geopolitical tensions, inflation and higher-than-expected revenues. Multiple crises emphasized the need for governments to better prepare for future emergencies. "

name: "The trillions needed to achieve the SDGs require world leaders to rapidly scale up investments"
text: "Mobilizing financial resources is crucial for driving global recovery and achieving the SDGs. In 2023, the annual SDG investment gap in developing countries was estimated at about $4 trillion, with over half, or $2.2 trillion, needed for the energy transition alone. The current investment gap is 60 per cent higher than the $2.5 trillion estimated in 2019. The increase results from shortfalls since 2015, compounded by multiple global challenges, including the pandemic and the food, fuel and financing crises. \n\nIn 2023, ODA from Development Assistance Committee members totalled $223.7 billion, representing 0.37 per cent of members’ combined gross national income. This marked a 1.8 per cent increase in real terms from 2022 and a 47 per cent rise from 2015, making it the fifth consecutive year of record-high ODA. The increase was primarily driven by aid for Ukraine, humanitarian assistance and contributions to international organizations. Net bilateral ODA flows to Africa increased by 2 per cent and to LDCs by 3 per cent. \n\nGlobal foreign direct investment (FDI) flows in 2023 amounted to $1.33 trillion, a decrease of 2 per cent from 2022. Excluding a few European conduit economies that registered large swings in investment flows, global FDI flows were 10 per cent lower than in 2022. FDI flows to developing countries fell by 7 per cent to $867 billion and declined or stagnated in most regions. \n\nRemittances have proven resilient. They have become the premier source of external finance for developing countries in the post-COVID-19 period. In 2023, remittances to low- and middle-income countries reached an estimated $669 billion, reflecting a normalization of flows following the post-pandemic robust growth. The United States remained the largest source of remittances in the world, followed by Saudi Arabia and Switzerland. The global average cost of sending a $200 remittance was 6.4 per cent in 2023, more than twice the SDG target of 3 per cent. Development impacts of remittances can be augmented by reducing remittance costs and worker-paid recruitment costs.\n\nIn 2022, additional financial resources for developing countries from multiple sources, reported by 101 bilateral and multilateral providers to measure total official support for sustainable development (TOSSD), amounted to $342.1 billion. This included $276.6 billion in official resources, $55.3 billion from private finance and $10.2 billion from private grants for development. Sustainable development grants (both official and private) decreased from $129.2 billion in 2021 to $127.5 billion in 2022. Sustainable concessional development loans increased by 6 per cent from $54.8 billion in 2021 to $58.0 billion in 2022, while non-concessional loans decreased from 106.9 billion in 2021 to $101.3 billion in 2022. Mobilized private finance increased by 21 per cent from 2021. \n\nAt the SDG Summit in September 2023, heads of State and government committed to advancing the Secretary-General’s SDG Stimulus proposal of unlocking $500 billion in additional financing and investment annually.\n"

text: "In 2022, the external debt stock of low- and middle-income countries fell for the first time since 2015, dropping to $9.0 trillion from $9.3 trillion in 2021. Even so, external debt stock levels remained unprecedentedly high after more than a decade of rapid debt accumulation. In 2022, the external debt stock of countries eligible to borrow from the International Development Association (IDA) – which supports the poorest countries in boosting economic development – increased by 2.7 per cent, reaching a record high of $1.1 trillion. Public and publicly guaranteed debt service payments by low- and middle-income countries hit a record $444 billion and are forecast to continue growing. Interest payments on total external debt stock by IDA-eligible countries have doubled since 2015 to $23.6 billion and are expected to rise further as global interest rates trend upward. About 60 per cent of low-income countries are at high risk of debt distress or already experiencing it. Increasing borrowing costs have and will continue to divert scarce resources from critical development needs such as poverty reduction, climate action, health and education. \n"

text: "High-quality, timely and disaggregated data are crucial for guiding decision-making on all SDGs. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly hindered the ability of national statistical offices to collect recent data. This has led to a small decline in the average Open Data Inventory (ODIN) coverage scores from 2020 to 2022, mainly in low- and middle-income countries. Even in the most resource-rich countries, the average ODIN data coverage score remains below 60 out of 100, highlighting the urgent need for increased investment in data infrastructure and production. Despite these gaps, the long-term trajectory of data coverage score tracks upward.\n\nBased on the Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI), global scores on the Data Sources Performance Index and Data Infrastructure Performance Index improved between 2016 and 2023. Data sources gained only 3 points, held back in part by COVID-19 disruptions, while data infrastructure, both the hard and soft infrastructure to produce data, increased by around 14 points.\n\nIn 2023, 159 countries and territories reported having statistical legislation compliant with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, up from 132 in 2019, indicating significant progress in modernizing national statistical systems. Additionally, 163 countries implemented national statistical plans, up from 143 in 2019, with 109 fully funded. showed international support for data and statistics development has increased, reaching $799 million in 2021, 14 per cent above 2020 and 44 per cent above 2015. Funding gaps remain a major issue, particularly in Africa and the LDCs, where only a fraction of plans is fully funded. This resource insufficiency threatens the resilience of statistical systems and risks leaving vulnerable populations behind. Addressing these challenges requires more funding, mainstreamed data activities and strategic planning aligned with emerging development priorities."
