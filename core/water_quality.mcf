Node: dcs:PH
typeOf: schema:Property
name: Potential of Hydrogens (pH)
description: "pH is a quantitative measure of the acidity or basicity of aqueous or other liquid solutions. Solutions with less than 7 are considered acidic whereas the solutions with pH greater than 7 are known as basic."

## Units of Measures

Node: dcid:MilligramsPerLitre
typeOf: dcs:ConcentrationUnitOfMeasure
name: "Milligrams Per Litre"

Node: dcid:MicrogramsPerLitre
typeOf: dcs:ConcentrationUnitOfMeasure
name: "Micrograms Per Litre"

Node: dcid:MilligramsCaCO3PerLitre
typeOf: dcs:ConcentrationUnitOfMeasure
name: "Milligrams CaCO3 Per Litre"
description: "Carbonate hardness is a measure of the water hardness caused by the presence of carbonate and is usually expressed as mgCaCO3/L (Milligrams CaCO3 Per Litre) â€“ meaning the concentration of carbonate expressed as if calcium carbonate were the sole source of carbonate ions."
