The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (PL 111-296) includes provisions for determining free and reduced-price lunch (FRL) eligibility that may affect the reliability and availability of the FRL counts reported to EDFacts (FS033). Under provisions 2 and 3 of the law, annual certification of individual students is not required. A new provision, the Community Eligibility Option (CEO or Provision 4), eliminates the requirement for individual eligibility information once a school has determined a baseline percentage of FRL eligible students. These changes may result in missing or out of date FRL counts. Education researchers frequently use FRL eligibility as an indicator of student socioeconomic status (SES). The NSLP status provides these researchers with an indication of the reliability of the FRL counts reported in this file."
