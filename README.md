# Data Commons Schema MCF Files

This directory contains the MCF nodes for all defined schemas in Data Commons.

These files are kept in-sync with the Google repository via Copybara:

-   Changes inside Google are immediately copied here.
-   Approved GitHub pull requests are sent to the Google respository, where it
    is tested; if approved, the PR will merge into both the Google and GitHub
    repository.
    -   IMPORTANT: DO NOT MERGE schema changes (any files ending with .mcf).
        Copybara will directly commit to the main branch then mark your PR as
        merged.
